# Legend Weathers

### This mod aims to add multiple special weather effects to the game. Still in development, there is currently **1 weather** effect that is completely playable and more are planned in future releases.

Weathers in this mod are designed to be rare and impactful. They **are NOT like vanilla weathers**, and are meant to be seen very rarely due to their *extreme* effects. You can customize the spawn chance in the WeatherRegistery config but by default it is pretty low.

Compatible with v69/v70/v72 of Lethal Company.

Inspired by the iconic astral figure from *The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask*, this event features a destructive celestial body that threatens all life forms.

The **Majora Moon** is set to crash on the planet in a few hours, giving you less time to find scraps in the facility.

Ocasional ground rumbles will remind you of the Moon's impending collision... Don't waste any more time as with this weather active, you'll be able to find more scraps than usual, offering a chance to meet the profit quota!

After some moments, the sky will turn purple and a timer will appear on the bottom of the screen... inviting you to leave the planet **at once**.

The time before the crash is a bit generous but the Company Ship has been programmed to leave automatically. Manage your time well to avoid being *obliterated from the surface of this world*.

### Majora's Mask

When the Majora Moon Weather is active, an accursed and dangerous item will spawn inside the facility: the **Majora's Mask**.

While this mask is worth a **HUGE sum** of money, it comes with severe *side effects*... such as **a̷̤̖̾c̷͈̪̐͂c̴̯͐ȇ̷̜̹͗l̷̜͙̑̾e̷̢̙̓r̴̙̊a̵̤̍͐͜t̸̠͉͆͊ỉ̶̖̦͠n̶̤͂g̴͔͎̐̋ ̸̟̅̕t̶̳͍̓h̴̩̾e̵̫̲̒̒ ̶̼̀͝M̵̗͆å̸̙͗j̶̟̰̽ò̷̝̓r̸̃͝ͅả̵͎ ̸̠̋M̵̢̿̀o̷̰̅̍o̴͚̣͊͝n̸͕̙͝**.

###
It is said that an evil and wicked power is bestowed upon the one who wears that mask. Don't even try, the result is **far worse** than a typical Masked enemy.

Moon's Tears are some kind of shiny stones. Rumored to fall from the Moon's eye, they can be picked up by employees as highly valuable scraps.

According to legend... each apparition of the Majora Moon has *1% chance* of triggering a rare Tears Showers event.

### Compatibility with other mods
- The Majora Moon Weather only works on planets **that have time**. Also, it is not recommended to spawn it manually mid-game.
- It comes with a **custom fog volume** that  dynamically changes the sky's color over time. Some *visual bugs* related to the sky and fogs can happen on some modded moons depending on how they were made.
- The Majora Moon position in the sky is automatically determined but can be manually adjusted on specific planets for better placement. If you think the actual placement is not visually good, you can report the moon's name so I can improve the position on this specific moon.
- A special compatible animation has been added when playing the Ocarina item from [ChillaxScraps](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zigzag/ChillaxScraps/) !
- This mod is compatible with [WeatherTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrov/WeatherTweaks/) and [LethalElementsBeta](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/v0xx/LethalElementsBeta/).
