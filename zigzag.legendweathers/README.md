# Legend Weathers

This mod adds multiple special weather effects to the game. Added weathers are inspired and modified from events in other games.

These weathers **are NOT like the vanilla content**, and are meant to be seen very rarely due to their *insane* effects. You can customize the spawn chance in the WeatherRegistery config but by default it is half of the vanilla spawn chance.

This mod is still in development, there is currently **1** weather effect that is completly playable but I plan of adding more in the future.

Compatible with v69 of Lethal Company.

### Compatibility with other mods
- The Majora Moon Weather only works on planets **that have time**.
- It comes with a **custom fog volume** that change the color of the sky overtime. Some visual bugs *(concerning sky and fog)* can happen on some modded moons depending on how they were made.
- The Majora Moon position in the sky is determined automatically on all moons, but can be improved with a manual placement. So, you may notice it being weirdly placed on some modded moons : if you think the actual placement is not good, you can report the moon's name so I can improve the placement on this specific moon.
