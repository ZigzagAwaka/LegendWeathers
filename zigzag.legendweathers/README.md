# Legend Weathers

This mod adds multiple weather effects to the game, coming directly from various other games such as The Legend of Zelda !

These weathers **are NOT like the vanilla content**, and are meant to be seen very rarely due to their *insane* effects. You can customize the spawn chance in the WeatherRegistery config but by default it is pretty low.

Compatible with v69 of Lethal Company.
